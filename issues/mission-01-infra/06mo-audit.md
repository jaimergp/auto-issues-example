## üìå Summary

The goal is to audit and document existing conda-forge's infrastructure.

> This will be done in public. 
> We need to ensure no critical security details such as credentials are exposed.

## üìù Background

To propose technical debt reduction measures and ensure the long-term viability of the project and its growing ecosystem, we first need to understand and document the current status of the platform.

Expected challenges:

- Large number of moving parts across services and platforms
- Several accounts and credentials key to the normal operating conditions
- Lack of documentation for each part
- Scattered institutional knowledge

## üöÄ Tasks / Deliverables

- [ ] Choose / create repository to store WIP documentation
- [ ] Document existing infrastructure
- [ ] Safely enumerate required credentials
- [ ] Access control: on- and off-boarding core members
- [ ] Compile an audit report with suggestions and best practices

## üìÖ Estimated completion

This task should be finished in the first [six months](__MILESTONE_URL__).
