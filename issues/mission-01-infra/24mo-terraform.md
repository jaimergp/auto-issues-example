title: Finalize migration to Terraform
milestone: "24 months"
labels: [mission::infra]
---

## 📌 Summary

Migration to Terraform for critical infrastructure parts.


## 📝 Background

At this point, the infrastructure should have accumulated enough improvements with or without IaC approaches.
Finalizing its migration to Terraform or similar will help us with provisioning, scalability, recovery and risk aversion.

Having this goal in the 24 months milestone does _not_ mean it should only start in the last six months of the project,
rather than it should be completed by this time. 

## 🚀 Tasks / Deliverables

- [ ] TBD.

## 📅 Estimated completion

This task should be finished by the end of the project (24 months).
