## Transparent, open & sustainable infrastructure for conda-forge and bioconda

The conda-forge and bioconda projects were founded in 2015 in response to frustrations scientific software users consistently faced when attempting to install system package dependencies. Installing open-source software packages with binary dependencies is frequently a multistep process involving an intricate sequence of software compilation. 
The emergence of conda-forge massively reduced the scientific packaging toil by building on transparency, automation, compatibility and open-source principles. 
As a result, its community has grown exponentially, as has the number of artifacts hosted and downloaded (~18 thousand packages hosted and ~300 million package downloads/month).

Such growth has significantly increased the pressure on its underlying infrastructure, tooling, and maintainers' workflow. 
Besides, this entire infrastructure and community solely rely on the anaconda.org service as a hosting provider.

This project aims to improve the long-term sustainability of the conda-forge/bioconda projects and their ecosystem through three main work items or missions.
These have been identified with the following `mission::*` labels:

* `mission::infra`: Reducing technical debt with Infrastructure as Code approaches.
* `mission::mirror`: Enabling mirroring capabilities with OCI-based storage.
* `mission::dashboard`: Building a maintainers dashboard with Quetz.

## üìÖ Estimated completion

The project is scheduled to take approximately two years, from December 2022 to January 2025.
We have established time-based milestones at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months.
Some tasks are labeled as `stretch` goals in case there's time and resources to tackle them.

These milestones are available in the project Milestones tab.
