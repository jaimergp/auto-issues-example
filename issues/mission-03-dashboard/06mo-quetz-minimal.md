## 📌 Summary

Deploy a minimal Quetz instance for conda-forge and bioconda

## 📝 Background

[Quetz](https://github.com/mamba-org/quetz) is an open-source server for conda packages and channel metadata.
Its UI frontend can be extended with components.

The idea is to have a running instance that the team can use to iterate on the planned features and receive feedback from the community.

## 🚀 Tasks / Deliverables

- [ ] Decide hosting / domain / infra details
- [ ] Configure vanilla Quetz server and put it online
- [ ] Devise workflow to make the new features available in the preview

## 📅 Estimated completion

This task should be finished within the first six months.
