## üìå Summary

Prepare the conda ecosystem for OCI-based storage compatibility.

## üìù Background

OCI (Open Container Initiative) registries are a well-defined standard for versioned blob storage already implemented by many public cloud providers (i.e. GitHub). 
We plan to leverage the OCI registry on GitHub Packages to develop a community-maintained mirror for bioconda and conda-forge. 

Besides, adopting an OCI-based strategy will provide additional flexibility for metadata expansion. 
With this in mind, we aim to produce and capture more comprehensive package metadata, which we will later use for: maintenance dashboards, package search functions, and security checks.

> A prototype mirror is already available at the [`channel-mirrors` organization](https://github.com/orgs/channel-mirrors/packages).
